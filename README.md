## Overview

**Prashasanik Shabdwali** is a comprehensive bilingual glossary providing official Hindi translations and equivalents for English administrative, legal, financial, and governmental terms. This resource is designed to assist translators, bureaucrats, lawyers, educators, and anyone working in official or administrative contexts in India where Hindi is used alongside English.

The glossary is compiled as a simple, alphabetical list of terms, making it easy to reference and integrate into documents, websites, or translation tools. It draws from standard official sources to ensure accuracy and relevance in administrative communication.

### Key Features
- **Alphabetical Organization**: Terms are listed from A to Z (e.g., "Ab initio" to "Overrun").
- **Bilingual Format**: Each entry follows the structure `English Term — Hindi Translation(s)` (e.g., `Ab initio — आरम्भ से, शुरू से, आदितः`).
- **Broad Coverage**: Includes ~2,500 entries spanning legal, financial, procedural, and everyday administrative vocabulary.
- **Devanagari Script**: Hindi equivalents are provided in standard Devanagari for authenticity.
- **Plain Text**: Easy to parse, search, or import into other tools (e.g., spreadsheets, apps).
